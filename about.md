title: About me
excerpt: "on myself"
---

I am a Full Professor of Biometrics at the Universidad Mayor in Santiago, Chile. My research interests are related to theoretical and applied statistics for quantitative analyses of biological data, emphasising ecological and natural resources phenomena.

My [educational background](./educa.md) involved moving from forest sciences to statistics and mathematical modelling. Besides, I have been fortunate enough to meet my [mentors](./mentors.md), which have been vital for my current duties.  Furthermore, my collaborative work with Chilean and foreign colleagues has strength the application of my knowledge to different disciplines and problems.
