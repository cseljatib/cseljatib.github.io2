title: About me
excerpt: "on myself"
---

I am a Full Professor of Biometrics at the Universidad Mayor, in Santiago, Chile. My research interests are related to theoretical and applied statistics for quantitative analyses of biological data, with an emphasis on ecological and natural resources phenomena.

My [educational background](./educa.md) had involved moving from forest sciences to statistics and mathematical modelling. Besides, through this, I have been fortunate enough for meeting my mentors or professors that have been key for my current duties. Furthermore, my collaborative work with Chilean and foreign colleagues has strength the application of my knowledge to different disciplines and problems.
