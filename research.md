--------

My research focuses on the development and application of statistical and mathematical models to address problems in ecological research.

My main research interest is biometrics, i.e., applied statistics and mathematical modelling for understanding ecological and natural resources phenomena.

## Research lines

* __Biometrics__. Applied statistics to ecology and natural resources.

* __Forest ecosystem modelling__.  Tree and stand level growth models.

* __Ecological modelling and statistical ecology__. System dynamics, differential equations, statistical inference.

* __Applied statistics to forest ecology__. Spatial statistics, tree allometry, sampling, estimation from remote sensed images.


## Research projects

I am currently working in a couple of research projects, as well as I have been involved in several ones. [Our current ongoing research projects can be found here](./resproj.md)
