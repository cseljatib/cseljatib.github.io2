--------

My research focuses on developing and applying statistical and mathematical models to address scientific and decision-support problems of forests and ecology.

My main research interest is biometrics, i.e., applied statistics and mathematical modelling for understanding ecological and natural resources phenomena.

## Research lines

* __Biometrics__. Applied statistics to ecology and natural resources.

* __Forest ecosystem modelling__.  Tree and stand level growth models.

* __Ecological modelling and statistical ecology__. System dynamics, differential equations, statistical inference.

* __Applied statistics to forest ecology__. Spatial statistics, tree allometry, sampling, estimation from remote sensed images.


## Research projects

I am currently working in a couple of research projects, as well as I have been involved in several ones. [Our current ongoing research projects can be found here](./resproj.md)
